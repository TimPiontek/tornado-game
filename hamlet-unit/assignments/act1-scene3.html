            <h2>Scene Summary</h2>
            <p>Laertes prepares to return to France and gives advice to his sister Ophelia about her relationship with Hamlet. He warns her that Hamlet's love for her may not be genuine, as princes often cannot choose their own spouses. Polonius enters and gives Laertes lengthy advice about how to behave in France, including the famous 'to thine own self be true' speech. After Laertes leaves, Polonius questions Ophelia about her relationship with Hamlet and forbids her from seeing him, claiming that Hamlet's advances are not serious.</p>
