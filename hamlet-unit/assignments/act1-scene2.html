            <p>This scene takes place in the royal court of Denmark. King Claudius addresses the court, acknowledging both the death of his brother King Hamlet and his recent marriage to Queen Gertrude. He also deals with the threat from young Fortinbras of Norway. Hamlet is introduced for the first time, appearing in mourning clothes and expressing his deep grief over his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Claudius and Gertrude try to convince Hamlet to stop mourning and accept the new situation. Hamlet's first soliloquy reveals his suicidal thoughts and his disgust with the world, particularly his mother's quick remarriage to his uncle.</p>
