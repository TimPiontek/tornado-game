            <p>Claudius, alone and guilt-ridden, attempts to pray for forgiveness but realizes he cannot truly repent while still enjoying the benefits of his crime. Hamlet enters and sees Claudius praying, but decides not to kill him because he believes killing Claudius while he is praying would send him to heaven. This scene reveals Hamlet's moral complexity and his tendency to overthink his actions.</p>
