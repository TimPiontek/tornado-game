            <h2>Scene Summary</h2>
            <p>The play opens on the battlements of Elsinore Castle in Denmark. It is midnight, and Francisco, a guard, is being relieved by Bernardo. The two guards discuss the strange events of the past few nights, during which they have seen what appears to be the ghost of the recently deceased King Hamlet. Marcellus and Horatio arrive, and Horatio, a scholar and Hamlet's close friend, is skeptical about the ghost's existence. However, when the ghost appears, Horatio recognizes it as the late king and attempts to speak to it. The ghost does not respond and disappears at dawn. This supernatural encounter sets the tone for the play and introduces the central mystery of King Hamlet's death.</p>
